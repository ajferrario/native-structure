# structural components for react-native

In the process of building my first React-Native (RN) app I've found that the default View components combined with the flexbox-like properties made available within RN are very confusing and tend to cost large amounts of time due to the non-intuitive nature of the way the styling properties combine. In order to solve this problem I came up with these basic components which will act as more intelligent substitutes for the View component and do a better job of handling the different structural layouts which are commonly found in apps more gracefully.
